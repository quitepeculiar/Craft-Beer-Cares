			We take part in events run by amazing people with a passion for
			fundraising, and have organised events combining charitable aims with the
			enjoyment of beer made by some of the most talented breweries in the UK
			and beyond.
		</p>

		<p>
			Our events have raised funds for charities such as Art Against Knives,
			Hackney Winter Night Shelter, Mind, The Newman Holiday Trust and more!

				What impressed me most was the collegial and friendly environment, among
